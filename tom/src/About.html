Tom's Solutions for the Advent of Code<br />
TSAOC v0.3.0<br /><br />
This is a simple program for solving the Advent of Code (AOC) 2020 and 2021. My
main objective is educational: I am learning modern web programming. I
initially implemented the program as a single file containing CSS, HTML,
and JavaScript. This obviously would not be a good choice for multi-person
projects. Tho this is not industry best practice, it has a certain
perverse elegance and, I think, made refactoring, version control, and
code reuse simpler. I am extremely thankful for editor folding.<br /><br />
The single file approach became unweildy, because the file contained
verbose problem statements and input data. Code folding and Prittier
occasionally choked -- leaving a big mess. On day 10 I restructured the
development environment. I now use a build.js file, run from Node.js,
to create the final single-file HTML/CSS/JavaScript bundle from smaller files
in subfolders that are easier to create and edit.<br /><br />
