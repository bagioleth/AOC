<p>As you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that <span title="Don't worry, nobody ever misreads just one word in real life.">you misread one word</span> in the instructions:</p>
<p>You don't need to identify the questions to which <em>anyone</em> answered "yes"; you need to identify the questions to which <em>everyone</em> answered "yes"!</p>
<p>Using the same example as above:</p>
<pre><code>abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b
</code></pre>
<p>This list represents answers from five groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to <em><code>3</code></em> questions: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</li>
    <li>In the second group, there is <em>no</em> question to which everyone answered "yes".</li>
    <li>In the third group, everyone answered yes to only <em><code>1</code></em> question, <code>a</code>. Since some people did not answer "yes" to <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>, they don't count.</li>
    <li>In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only <em><code>1</code></em> question, <code>a</code>.</li>
    <li>In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to <em><code>1</code></em> question, <code>b</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the sum of these counts is <code>3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1</code> = <em><code>6</code></em>.</p>
<p>For each group, count the number of questions to which <em>everyone</em> answered "yes". <em>What is the sum of those counts?</em></p>
<br />
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>3402</code>.
