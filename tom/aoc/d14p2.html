<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2>
<p>For some reason, the sea port's computer system still can't communicate with your ferry's docking program. It must be using <em>version 2</em> of the decoder chip!</p>
<p>A version 2 decoder chip doesn't modify the values being written at all. Instead, it acts as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvfhANgLrm4" target="_blank">memory address decoder</a>. Immediately before a value is written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of the destination <em>memory address</em> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the bitmask bit is <code>0</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <em>unchanged</em>.</li>
    <li>If the bitmask bit is <code>1</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <em>overwritten with <code>1</code></em>.</li>
    <li>If the bitmask bit is <code>X</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <span title="Technically, since you're on a boat, they're all floating."><em>floating</em></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>floating</em> bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on <em>all possible values</em>, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all at once!</p>
<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>
<pre><code>mask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
mem[42] = 100
mask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
mem[26] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>When this program goes to write to memory address <code>42</code>, it first applies the bitmask:</p>
<pre><code>address: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)
mask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
result:  000000000000000000000000000000<em>X1</em>10<em>1X</em>
</code></pre>
<p>After applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are different, and two of which are <em>floating</em>. Floating bits take on every possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory addresses are written:</p>
<pre><code>000000000000000000000000000000<em>0</em>1101<em>0</em>  (decimal 26)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>0</em>1101<em>1</em>  (decimal 27)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1101<em>0</em>  (decimal 58)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1101<em>1</em>  (decimal 59)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, the program is about to write to memory address <code>26</code> with a different bitmask:</p>
<pre><code>address: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)
mask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
result:  00000000000000000000000000000001<em>X</em>0<em>XX</em>
</code></pre>
<p>This results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to <em>eight</em> memory addresses:</p>
<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>00</em>  (decimal 16)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>01</em>  (decimal 17)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>10</em>  (decimal 18)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>11</em>  (decimal 19)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>00</em>  (decimal 24)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>01</em>  (decimal 25)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>10</em>  (decimal 26)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>11</em>  (decimal 27)
</code></pre>
<p>The entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at the end of the program. In this example, the sum is <em><code>208</code></em>.</p>
<p>Execute the initialization program using an emulator for a version 2 decoder chip. <em>What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?</em></p>
