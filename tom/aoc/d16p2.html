<p>Now that you've identified which tickets contain invalid values, <em>discard those tickets entirely</em>. Use the remaining valid tickets to determine which field is which.</p>
<p>Using the valid ranges for each field, determine what order the fields appear on the tickets. The order is consistent between all tickets: if <code>seat</code> is the third field, it is the third field on every ticket, including <em>your ticket</em>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the following notes:</p>
<pre><code>class: 0-1 or 4-19
row: 0-5 or 8-19
seat: 0-13 or 16-19

your ticket:
11,12,13

nearby tickets:
3,9,18
15,1,5
5,14,9
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the <em>nearby tickets</em> in the above example, the first position must be <code>row</code>, the second position must be <code>class</code>, and the third position must be <code>seat</code>; you can conclude that in <em>your ticket</em>, <code>class</code> is <code>12</code>, <code>row</code> is <code>11</code>, and <code>seat</code> is <code>13</code>.</p>
<p>Once you work out which field is which, look for the six fields on <em>your ticket</em> that start with the word <code>departure</code>. <em>What do you get if you multiply those six values together?</em></p>
