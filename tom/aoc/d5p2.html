<p><em>Ding!</em> The "fasten seat belt" signs have turned on. Time to find your seat.</p>
<p>It's a completely full flight, so your seat should be the only missing boarding pass in your list. However, there's a catch: some of the seats at the very front and back of the plane don't exist on this aircraft, so they'll be missing from your list as well.</p>
<p>Your seat wasn't at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list.</p>
<p><em>What is the ID of your seat?</em></p>
<br />
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>615</code>.
