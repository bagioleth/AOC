<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2>
<p>After some careful analysis, you believe that <em>exactly one instruction is corrupted</em>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the program, <em>either</em> a <code>jmp</code> is supposed to be a <code>nop</code>, <em>or</em> a <code>nop</code> is supposed to be a <code>jmp</code>. (No <code>acc</code> instructions were harmed in the corruption of this boot code.)</p>
<p>The program is supposed to terminate by <em>attempting to execute an instruction immediately after the last instruction in the file</em>. By changing exactly one <code>jmp</code> or <code>nop</code>, you can repair the boot code and make it terminate correctly.</p>
<p>For example, consider the same program from above:</p>
<pre><code>nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6
</code></pre>
<p>If you change the first instruction from <code>nop +0</code> to <code>jmp +0</code>, it would create a single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction. If you change almost any of the <code>jmp</code> instructions, the program will still eventually find another <code>jmp</code> instruction and loop forever.</p>
<p>However, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from <code>jmp -4</code> to <code>nop -4</code>), the program terminates! The instructions are visited in this order:</p>
<pre><code>nop +0  | 1
acc +1  | 2
jmp +4  | 3
acc +3  |
jmp -3  |
acc -99 |
acc +1  | 4
<em>nop</em> -4  | 5
acc +6  | 6
</code></pre>
<p>After the last instruction (<code>acc +6</code>), the program terminates by attempting to run the instruction below the last instruction in the file. With this change, after the program terminates, the accumulator contains the value <em><code>8</code></em> (<code>acc +1</code>, <code>acc +1</code>, <code>acc +6</code>).</p>
<p>Fix the program so that it terminates normally by changing exactly one <code>jmp</code> (to <code>nop</code>) or <code>nop</code> (to <code>jmp</code>). <em>What is the value of the accumulator after the program terminates?</em></p>
