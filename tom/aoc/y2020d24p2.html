<p>The tile floor in the lobby is meant to be a <span title="I need one of these!">living art exhibit</span>. Every day, the tiles are all flipped according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any <em>black</em> tile with <em>zero</em> or <em>more than 2</em> black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to <em>white</em>.</li>
    <li>Any <em>white</em> tile with <em>exactly 2</em> black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to <em>black</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <em>tiles immediately adjacent</em> means the six tiles directly touching the tile in question.</p>
<p>The rules are applied <em>simultaneously</em> to every tile; put another way, it is first determined which tiles need to be flipped, then they are all flipped at the same time.</p>
<p>In the above example, the number of black tiles that are facing up after the given number of days has passed is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Day 1: 15
Day 2: 12
Day 3: 25
Day 4: 14
Day 5: 23
Day 6: 28
Day 7: 41
Day 8: 37
Day 9: 49
Day 10: 37

Day 20: 132
Day 30: 259
Day 40: 406
Day 50: 566
Day 60: 788
Day 70: 1106
Day 80: 1373
Day 90: 1844
Day 100: 2208
</code></pre>
<p>After executing this process a total of 100 times, there would be <em><code>2208</code></em> black tiles facing up.</p>
<p><em>How many tiles will be black after 100 days?</em></p>
